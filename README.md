# Eto.Forms.SkiaSharp
SkiaSharp Canvas Controls for Eto.Forms

This project exposes a 2D drawing canvas (SKCanvas) to Eto.Forms applications as a Control. You can use it to do custom drawing using the CPU or GPU to render text, shapes, images and animations.

**Eto.Forms** is a GUI toolkit which can be used to build applications that run across multiple platforms using their native toolkit, with an easy to use API. It currently supports creating Desktop applications that work across Windows Forms, WPF, MonoMac, and GTK#.

**SkiaSharp** is a cross-platform 2D graphics API for .NET platforms based on Google's Skia Graphics Library (https://skia.org/). It provides a comprehensive 2D API that can be used across mobile, server and desktop models to render images.
